# SpeedTest

[Arduino](http://arduino.cc) library that calculates average loop duration.

Useful for testing code optimizations.

#### Installation

- Download the most recent version of SpeedTest here: https://github.com/per1234/SpeedTest/archive/master.zip
- Using Arduino IDE 1.0.x:
  - **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**
- Using Arduino IDE 1.5+:
  - **Sketch > Include Library > Add ZIP Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**
- Updating to a new version - Note that installation via the Arduino IDE only can be done for the initial installation. To update to a new version you must install the library manually:
  - Delete the previous library installation at **{sketchbook}/libraries/SpeedTest-master**
  - Copy the folder, **SpeedTest-master**, from the downloaded .zip file to your **{sketchbook folder}/libraries** folder. You can find the location of your sketchbook folder at **File > Preferences > Sketchbook location**.
  - If using Arduino IDE 1.6.5-r5 or earlier, restart the Arduino IDE if it's running.

#### Usage

See the example sketch in **File > Examples > SpeedTest > SpeedTestExample** for demonstration of usage.

##### `SpeedTest.begin(loops)`

Start the test.

- Parameter: **loops** - The number of loops before the test is finished.
  - Type: unsigned long
- Returns: none

##### `SpeedTest.update()`

Call this function on every loop.

- Returns: Whether the test is complete. `false`: Test not complete, `true`: Test complete.
  - Type: boolean

##### `SpeedTest.result()`

Call this after `SpeedTest.update()` returns true.

- Returns: The average duration of each loop in microseconds. Note that the SpeedTest library causes some overhead so the result will not be a perfect indicator of the true loop duration without the library but it does give an approximation and is useful for comparisons where the library overhead will have a uniform effect.
  - Type: float
